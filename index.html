    <h1>Common elements</h1>
    <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football,<br> Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and  <br> kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited</p>
    <p>Common rules among the sports include.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.</li>
    <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
